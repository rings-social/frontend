# frontend

The code for the frontend of [rings.social](https://rings.social),
a content-rating platform build around communities (rings).


## Demo

The content of this repository is automatically deployed on our domain,
https://rings.social.

Currently the backend doesn't support R/W operations - our goal is to 
start creating a basic set of functionalities before opening up the
instance to the public and allowing everyone to start using Rings.
